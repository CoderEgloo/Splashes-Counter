# Splashes-Counter
Description
This is a little python application + resourcepack that I made for MacOS that counts how many times you have opened the game. The application is very lightweight, opening Minecraft and editing the splashes.txt file. 
testing took a while üò¨
How to Use
To use the application you will need some basic computer know how. 
1. Right click on the application and choose "Show Package Contents"
2. Navigate to Contents/Resources/minecraft.py
3. Open the file in your preferred text editor
4. You will see 3 path instances; edit these to your location for the Splashes texturepack
If you want to reset the counter, delete all the text within the log.txt file
